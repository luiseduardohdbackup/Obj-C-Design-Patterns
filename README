Programming Design Patterns in Objective C

This repository contains source code, UML diagrams, and other assorted items (such as CodeBox libraries), to support the book I am trying to get funded call Programming Design Patterns in Objective C (Kickstarter project located at http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1037840960/programming-design-patterns-in-objective-c).  

Even if my book does not get funded, my goal is to still provide this information to the community (and pass on my over 2 decades of software development experience).  All items are protected under the MIT Open Source License so use it as you like and please enjoy.
